# Development Portfolio 2 Coding Exercises

#### By David Clark

# Utilities Class Library

Utilities Class Library encapsulates various classes and methods that I developed since Development Portfolio 1 to simplify various repetitive coding tasks such as interacting with the user via console menus or prompting the user for and validating input against for appropriate type and meeting constraints.

# Time Tracker App

Time Tracker App is a database-connected console application that allows users to login and/or register an account with which he or she can track time spent on activities throughout the day with greater functionality than the Google Sheets time tracker first used by students in this course.

# Postcard

Postcard is an app somewhat inspired by studying the assumed design of iOS Mail--were it a console application supported by a relational database--but different all together.  In Postcard, registered users may send a postcard to any other registered user, and any registered user is free to browse all postcards sent.  It's kinda like how a real postcard is out in the open...  Anyone can read them once they're sent.

## Week 1

### Exercise 1

Console application that presents the user with a menu of options to manipulate a list of 20 clothing brands.
