# Development Portfolio 2 Coding Exercises

#### By David Clark

# Utilities Class Library

Utilities Class Library encapsulates various classes and methods that I developed since Development Portfolio 1 to simplify various repetitive coding tasks such as interacting with the user via console menus or prompting the user for and validating input against for appropriate type and meeting constraints.

# Time Tracker App

Time Tracker App is a database-connected console application that allows users to login and/or register an account with which he or she can track time spent on activities throughout the day with greater functionality than the Google Sheets time tracker first used by students in this course.

# Postcard

Postcard is an app somewhat inspired by studying the assumed design of iOS Mail--were it a console application supported by a relational database--but different all together.  In Postcard, registered users may send a postcard to any other registered user, and any registered user is free to browse all postcards sent.  It's kinda like how a real postcard is out in the open...  Anyone can read them once they're sent.

# Coding Exercises

## Week 1

### Exercise 1

Console application that presents the user with a menu of options to manipulate a list of 20 clothing brands.

### Exercise 2

Console application that prompts the user with clues, with which the user must guess the clothing brand-related answer.  Up to 10 successive clues may given, at which point, the correct answer will be shown to the user.

## Week 2

### Exercise 3

Console application that allows the user to view and edit student class grade percentages, also providing letter grades and GPA for viewing.

### Exercise 4

Console application that present user with some trivia about colors, in particular, the user's favorite color.

## Week 3

### Exercise 5

Console game against the computer of "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" that pits the user against the computer for 10 matches, with feedback about each match and a match summary.

### Exercise 6

Console card game where four users are dealt a deck of cards, the total point value of which they are dealt determines their placing, 1st through 4th place.
