# Development Portfolio 2 Coding Exercises

#### By David Clark

# Utilities Class Library

The Utilities Class Library encapsulates various classes and methods that I developed since Development Portfolio 1 to simplify various repetitive coding tasks such as interacting with the user via console menus or prompting the user for and validating input against for appropriate type and meeting constraints.

# Week 1

## Exercise 1

Console application that presents the user with a menu of options to manipulate a list of 20 clothing brands.

## Exercise 2

Console application that prompts the user with clues, with which the user must guess the clothing brand-related answer.  Up to 10 successive clues may given, at which point, the correct answer will be shown to the user.

# Week 2

## Exercise 3

Console application that allows the user to view and edit student class grade percentages, also providing letter grades and GPA for viewing.

## Exercise 4

Console application that present user with some trivia about colors, in particular, the user's favorite color.
